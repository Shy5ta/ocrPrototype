Bank Statement OCR Project

A collection of Python scripts showing my learning journey with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). I built this to learn how to extract and process data from scanned bank statements.

What This Project Does:
This project takes an image of a bank statement and:
1. Reads the text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
2. Extracts transaction details (dates, descriptions, amounts)
3. Cleans up the messy OCR output
4. Saves everything to an Excel file

It was challenging because bank statements have complex layouts and OCR isn't always perfect.

How I Did It:
I approached this step by step. Each file shows a different stage of my learning:

1. ocrTesting.py - My first ever OCR test
   - Just learned how to use Tesseract OCR
   - Read simple text from an image
   - Learned: How to install and set up OCR libraries

2. fnbTesting.py - First attempt at real bank statements
   - Tried to parse actual transactions
   - Used regex patterns to find dates and amounts
   - Learned: Real data is much messier than examples

3. debugFNBParsing.py- Debugging version
   - Added print statements to see what was happening
   - Found that OCR was misreading characters
   - Learned: How to debug when things don't work

4. enhance.py - Improving OCR accuracy
   - Added image preprocessing (grayscale, resize, contrast)
   - Made the text clearer for OCR to read
   - Learned: Image quality affects OCR results

5. cleanupDataParser.py- Final working version
   - Combined everything I learned
   - Better parsing with error handling
   - Cleans OCR mistakes and exports to Excel
   - Learned: How to build a complete solution

How to Use It:
1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the final version: `python cleanupDataParser.py`
3. The program will process `fnbTestStatement.png` and create an Excel file

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR (needs to be installed separately)
- Python libraries: pillow, pandas, pytesseract

Files Included:
- ocrTesting.py- Basic OCR test
- fnbTesting.py - First parsing attempt
- debugFNBParsing.py - Debugging version
- enhance.py - Image improvement version
- cleanupDataParser.py - Final working version
- requirements.txt - Required Python libraries

Note: The Excel output files are not included because they're generated by the program. They're listed in .gitignore so they don't get uploaded.

What Else I Want to Do:
If I continue this project, I'd like to:
1. Handle more bank statement formats
2. Add a simple GUI interface
3. Make it work with PDF files
4. Add better error messages
